# Project 3: Around The U.S.

## Project Features

- Full understanding of HTML/CSS
- BEM
- Responsive Design through grids and flex
- Figma
- Images
- Fonts

## Project Description

In this project, I created a simple but responsive single-page layout that utilizes flex and grids to create a webpage that expands and retracts depending on the display size of the user's device.
In these grids and flexboxes, I utilized their properties to set areas, sizing patterns, and various other characteristics that, when pieced together, create a balance in elements.

## Plans to Improve the Project

- For future updates to this project, I would like to add more detail to the webpage. Currently, the page is responsive from a display standpoint but not responsive to things such as following and editing profiles, liking images, and potentially expanding them for better clarity. I will make these all options in future updates, as well as I will add more of a database for switching from profile to profile.
