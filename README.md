## Project Description

In this project, I created a fully functional and responsive webpage. This page utilizes DOM, CSS, and Javascript to aid the user's experience, giving them the ability to customize the page as they would in a social media application through customization options within forms. I then connected the website to a database via API to save those changes, allowing the user to leave the webpage without it resetting every time.  

## Plans to Improve the Project

- For future updates to this project, I would like to add more in terms of customization. I plan to add some form of comment section for each card, and I would like to add a map with pins based on the geo-location assigned to each card.
